Given a singly linked list, delete middle of the linked list.

For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5 then linked list should be modified to 1->2->4->5

If there are even nodes, then there would be two middle nodes, we need to delete the second middle element.

For example, if given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6 then it should be modified to 1->2->3->5->6.

Return the head of the linked list after removing the middle node.

If the input linked list has 1 node, then this node should be deleted and a null node should be returned.


Input Format

The only argument given is the node pointing to the head node of the linked list
