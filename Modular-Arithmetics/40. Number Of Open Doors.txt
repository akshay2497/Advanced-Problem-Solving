Problem Description
Given an integer A, which denotes the number of doors in a row numbered 1 to A. All the doors are closed initially.

A person moves to and fro, changing the states of the doors as follows: the person opens a door that is already closed and closes a door that is already opened.

In the first go, he/she alters the states of doors numbered 1, 2, 3, … , A.
In the second go, he/she alters the states of doors numbered 2, 4, 6 ….
In the third go, he/she alters the states of doors numbered 3, 6, 9 …
This continues till the A'th go in, which you alter the state of the door numbered A.

Find and return the number of open doors at the end of the procedure.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 109



Input Format
The only argument given is integer A.



Output Format
Return the number of open doors at the end of the procedure.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = 5
Input 2:

 A = 6


Example Output
Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 2 


Example Explanation
Input 1:

 In the first go, he/she alters the states of doors numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Now, all doors are open.
 In the second go, he/she closes the doors numbered 2, 4.
 In the third go, he/she closes the door numbered 3.
 In the fourth go, he/she open the door numbered 4.
 In the fifth go, he/she closes the door numbered 5.
 Doors opened at the end are 1 and 4.
Input 2:

 In the first go, he/she alters the states of doors numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Now, all doors are open.
 In the second go, he/she closes the doors numbered 2, 4, 6.
 In the third go, he/she closes the door numbered 3 and opens door 6.
 In the fourth go, he/she open the door numbered 4.
 In the fifth go, he/she closes the door numbered 5.
 In the sixth go, he/she closes the door numbered 6.
 Doors opened at the end are 1 and 4.


//Java

public class Solution {
    public int solve(int A) {
        /*
        We observe that the number of time a door X alter its state is the number of 
        factors of that door X.
        If the number of factors is even, then the door will be closed; else, it will be open.

        So, we need to find the numbers between 1 to A for which the number of factors is odd.

        This leads to a very interesting observation that only the number which is perfect 
        square has an odd number of factors.
        How?
        If ‘a’ is a factor of ‘X’, then there will be a ‘b’ such that ‘a’ * ‘b’ = X.
        Only a number that is perfectly square has a factor ‘a’ such that ‘a’ * ‘a’ = X.

        So we will count the number of perfect squares between 1 and A, and that will be sqrt(A).

        Take a numer say 20 toggle the door state and find out how many doors will be in open 
        you will find door no 1,4,9 and 16 will be open at the end

        if you observe carefully they all are perfect squares so that means if you find 
        sqrt of given N and floor the value you will get total no of open doors.

        TC = O(1)) || SC = O(1)
        Looking at the actual code, which is not used by Oracle's java anyway, the complexity 
        of Math.sqrt is O(1). It loops 52 times: that's not Log(N), that's constant time, much 
        less efficient than using the floating point opcode, but still constant time.

        return (int)Math.floor(Math.sqrt(A));
