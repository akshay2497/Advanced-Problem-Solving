You are given an even number N and you need to represent the given number as the sum of primes. The prime numbers 
do not necessarily have to be distinct. It is guaranteed that at least one possible solution exists.

You need to determine the minimum number of prime numbers needed to represent the given number.

Input

The first argument contains an integer N,the number you need to represent (3<=N<=10^9).
Output

Return an integer which is the minimum number of prime numbers needed to represent the given number N.
Examples

Input

26
Output

2
Explanation

Testcase 1-

You can represent 26 as: 13+13
So we require minimum of 2 prime numbers to represent the number 26.

//Java

public class Solution {
    /*
    If any number can be represented as addition of two prime numbers, except when 
    it is a prime number itself. The minimum answer will always be 2 or 1.

    TC = O(sqrt(A)) || SC = O(1)
    */
    public int solve(int A) {
        return isPrime(A)? 1: 2;
    }
    public boolean isPrime(int A){
        for (int i = 2; i*i <= A; i++) {
            if(A % i == 0){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
