Problem Description
Given two Integers A, B. You have to calculate (A ^ (B!)) % (1e9 + 7).

"^" means power,

"%" means "mod", and

"!" means factorial.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A, B <= 5e5



Input Format
First argument is the integer A

Second argument is the integer B



Output Format
Return one integer, the answer to the problem



Example Input
Input 1:

A = 1
B = 1
Input 2:

A = 2
B = 2


Example Output
Output 1:

1
Output 2:

4


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 1! = 1. Hence 1^1 = 1.
Explanation 2:

 2! = 2. Hence 2^2 = 4.

public class Solution {
    public int solve(int A, int B) {
        /*
        This problem is very simple if you know Fermatâ€™s Little Theorem.

        The basic approach to solve this problem is to find factorial of B by taking mod with (P-1), 
        where P is a prime. In this problem, 10007 is also a prime.

        After calculating the factorial of B, you can calculate A ^ B! by simply taking mod with P.

        TC = O(B) + O(logB!) || SC = O(1)

        long fact = factorial(B, 1000000007-1);
        return pow(A, fact, 1000000007);
    }

    public long factorial(int B, int M){
        long fact = 1;
        for(int i =2; i <= B; i++){
            fact = (fact*i) % M;
        }
        return fact;
    }

    public int pow(int A, long B, int C) {
        if(A == 0 && B == 0)
            return 0;
        if(B == 0)
            return 1;
        long hp = pow(A, B/2, C);
        long fp = (hp%C * hp%C)%C;
        if(B % 2 == 0)
            return (int)((fp)%C);
        else
            return (int)((fp%C * A%C))%C;
    }
