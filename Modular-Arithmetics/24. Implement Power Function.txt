Problem Description
Implement pow(A, B) % C.
In other words, given A, B and C, Find (AB % C).

Note: The remainders on division cannot be negative. In other words, make sure the answer you return is non-negative.



Problem Constraints
-109 <= A <= 109
0 <= B <= 109
1 <= C <= 109


Input Format
Given three integers A, B, C.


Output Format
Return an integer.


Example Input
A = 2, B = 3, C = 3


Example Output
2


Example Explanation
23 % 3 = 8 % 3 = 2


//Java

public class Solution {
    public int pow(int A, int B, int C) {
        //If A and B is 0 then return 0
        if(A == 0 && B == 0)
            return 0;
        //Base condition if power is 0 return 1.
        if(B == 0)
            return 1;
        //Take half power of B to improve time complexity to logN.
        long hp = pow(A, B/2, C);
        //Multiply half power by itselef and calculate power of B in order 1 time.
        long fp = (hp%C * hp%C)%C;
        //If current Value of power is even then return the same power value.
        if(B % 2 == 0)
            return (int)((fp + C)%C);
        //else return power multiplied by element itself
        else
            return (int)((fp%C * A%C)+C)%C;
        //TC = O(LogB) || SC = O(1) if we dont consider memory stack
    }
