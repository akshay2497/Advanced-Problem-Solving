Problem Description

Given a string B, find if it is possible to re-order the characters of the string B so that it can be represented as a concatenation of A similar strings.

Eg: B = aabb and A = 2, then it is possible to re-arrange the string as "abab" which is a concatenation of 2 similar strings "ab".

If it is possible, return 1, else return -1.



Problem Constraints

1 <= Length of string B <= 1000

1 <= A <= 1000

All the alphabets of S are lower case (a - z)



Input Format

First argument is an integer A.
Second argument is a string B.



Output Format

Your function should return 1 if it is possible to re-arrange the characters of the string B so that it can be represented as a concatenation of A similar strings. If it is not, return -1.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = 2
 B = "bbaabb"
Input 2:

 A = 1
 B = "bc"


Example Output

Output 1:

 1
Output 2:

 1


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 We can re-order the given string into "abbabb".
Explanation 2:

 String "bc" is already arranged.


//Java


public class Solution {
    public int solve(int A, String B) {
        /*
        Each character must come in multiples of A if we are to represent the string as a concatenation of A strings.
        Why?

        Because that count divided by A will the number of times that particular character appears in 1 string.

        So we maintain a hash which stores the frequency of each character.

        Then we iterate over the hash and check if each character that appeared in the array appeared as a mutiple of A or not.
        If there exists even 1 character whose hash[i] % A is not equal to 0, it implies we cannot represent the string as A concatenated strings
        Else the answer is yes.

        HashMap<Character, Integer> mp = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < B.length(); i++){
            if(mp.containsKey(B.charAt(i))){
                mp.put(B.charAt(i), mp.get(B.charAt(i))+1);
            }else{
                mp.put(B.charAt(i), 1);
            }
        }
            
        for(char key : mp.keySet()){
            if(mp.get(key) % A != 0)
                return -1;
        }
        return 1;
    }
}
